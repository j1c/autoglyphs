# Autoglyphs

"Autoglyphs are an experiment in generative art, each one unique and created by code running on the Ethereum blockchain."

This repo contains the generation code for autoglyphs in Python. I believe the seeds are unknown so exact autoglyphs are not possible to generate, but you can make your own unique autoglyph.
Some of my favorite examples are below.

## Examples
